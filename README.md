# IP-Intelligence

Simple IP Intelligence is a service that determines high-risk ip addresses

## Usage

You can also use it without any parameters and query your current ip address.

```
curl https://check.mertcan.dev/check.php
```

or 

```
curl https://check.mertcan.dev/check.php?ip=<ip_address>
```

The dataset will not be made publicly available. Only high-risk IP addresses are included in the dataset.
